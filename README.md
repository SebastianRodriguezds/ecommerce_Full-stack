# LEBABA ECOMMERCE
Lebaba Ecommerce is a full-stack ecommerce web application built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It replicates a real online shopping experience, featuring product browsing, single product views, shopping cart functionality, and product reviews. Developed from scratch, with a custom backend API, secure authentication system, and a responsive frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. The goal was to practice full-stack architecture and real-world UI/UX behaviors.
